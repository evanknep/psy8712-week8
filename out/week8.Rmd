# **Reproducible Image and Online Resources**

An image of this project as of *`r Sys.Date()`* can be accessed by [clicking this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/evanknep/psy8712-week8/HEAD). 

An interactive web app is available by [clicking this link] instead. 

# **Script Settings and Resources**
```{r script settings, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(DT)
library(ggplot2)
```

# **Data Import and Cleaning**
Importing our dataset for preprocessing. Steps include reverse coding question q5 and converting our time columns into POSIX format. 

```{r data import and cleaning}
week8_tbl = read_csv("../data/week3.csv") %>% #initial data import
  mutate(q5 = 6 - q5) %>% #reverse coding our q5
  mutate(timeStart = as.POSIXct(timeStart)) %>% #converting our timestart and timeend columns to date time format
  mutate(timeEnd = as.POSIXct(timeEnd))
```
# **Visualization**
```{r visualization}
week8_tbl %>%
  select(q1:q6) %>% #selecting our desired subset of questions
  DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 5)) # creating a table with paginations


```








```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
